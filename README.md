# Guess the Number Game

## Overview
This is a simple "Guess the Number" game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 10. The computer randomly selects a number, and the user must guess it. The game provides feedback if the user's guess is too high or too low, and it also tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly. The user can choose to play again after each round.

## Features

- The user can guess the number, and the game will provide feedback.
- The number of attempts is counted and displayed once the user guesses the number correctly.
- The user is prompted whether they want to play again after each round.
- If the user guesses too high or too low, they are given appropriate feedback.
